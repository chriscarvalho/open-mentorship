# #OpenMentorship

**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge to anyone who could use it. Here are a few areas where I think I might be able to help:

- You are starting a new business and need some guidance on what to do first or validate your idea
- You need some guidance on managing a project or team
- You are starting a consulting project and want some direction
- You started contracting work and want some advice

## How to book a session

To book a session with me, simply find a date and time that works for the both of us in my calendar. No fees, no strings attached.

*Please don't use this time to solicit freelance or partnership work, ask about confidential information pertaining to me or my clients, or use this as a sales opportunity for your book, software, product, or service.*

## How to get involved

If you'd like to offer your mentor services to others, you're awesome! Here's a suggested set of steps to get going for yourself:

* Sign up to a service like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/).
* Decide how much time you would like to donate per week, and which day(s) work best for you. I'm starting with 2 30 minute blocks on Wednesday mornings.
* Let people know! Use [**#OpenMentorship**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openmentorship) in your social media posts to help potential mentorees find you.
* Help other mentors get set up, or encourage people in your industry to get involved.
