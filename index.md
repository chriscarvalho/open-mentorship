**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge to anyone who could use it. Here are a few areas where I think I might be able to help:

- You are starting a new business and need some guidance on what to do first or validate your idea
- You need some guidance on managing a project or team
- You are starting a consulting project and want some direction
- You started contracting work and want some advice

Our conversations can be about anything, there is no agenda, unless you want something more formal. Ask for career advice, feedback on a project, how to deal with difficult clients or situations, or anything else that’s on your mind[^1]. It’s your time to do with as you wish, no strings attached, no fees.


## What do I stand to gain?

I want to help you, but I also want you to help me. Through our conversation I hope to gain insights and an understanding of backgrounds and challenges I’ve not experienced. I may even ask you some questions for my own learning.


## Schedule

I’ve set aside two 30 minute blocks every Wednesday morning (8:30MST & 9:00MST), you may book **only one** of these blocks per week. I plan to keep my availability open on Wednesday mornings, but if you book less than a couple of days in advance I may have to cancel. If you view my calendar and there are no slots, send me an email and we’ll try work something out.
